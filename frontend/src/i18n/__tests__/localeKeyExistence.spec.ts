/**
 * Every `t('literal')` in the source must resolve in *both* locales.
 *
 * `localeParity` guards the *difference* between en and zh; it is blind by
 * construction to a key that is missing from both. That is not hypothetical:
 * a call site can be written against a key that was never added, and the two
 * locales stay in perfect parity while the UI renders the dotted key path
 * where a sentence belongs. This spec closes that hole from the other side —
 * it starts from the call sites rather than from the message files.
 *
 * ## Known limitation: dynamic keys are invisible here
 *
 * Only string *literals* are resolvable statically. A composed key such as
 *
 *     // views/admin/ProxiesView.vue:266
 *     t('admin.accounts.status.' + value)
 *
 * depends on runtime data (there, every member of `Proxy['status']`), so this
 * scan skips it entirely — the prefix is not a key and the suffix is unknown.
 * That whole class of call site still needs review by eye: when you add or
 * widen a union that feeds a key suffix, enumerate the members and check each
 * one by hand. `admin.accounts.status.expired` was missing for exactly this
 * reason and this spec would not have caught it.
 *
 * Template literals are skipped for the same reason when they interpolate;
 * a plain backtick string with no `${}` is treated as a literal.
